Your task is to statically analyze the control dependence of a given code snippet. \n\n## 1. Control Dependence Definition\n  Control dependence captures the influence of control-flow decisions on the execution of statements.\n\n  A statement `S2` is control-dependent on `S1` if there is a **transitive** (indirect) chain of **direct** control dependencies from `S1` to `S2`. This is equivalent to saying that `S1` has control dependence over `S2`, meaning `S1`\u2019s condition influences whether `S2` executes.\n\n\n  **Direct Control Dependence**:\n  A statement `S2` is **directly** control-dependent on a statement `S1` if:\n  \n  1.\t`S1` is a conditional control statement (e.g., an `if`, `while`, `for`, `switch`, etc.).\n  \n  2.\t`S1` directly determines whether `S2` executes. That is, `S1` has multiple successor branches, \n\n  - there exists **at least one branch** in which `S2` **always executes**, and\n  - there exists **at least one other branch** in which `S2` does **not necessarily execute**.\n\n    \u201cNot necessarily execute\u201d means that `S2` might execute or might not, but it is **not guaranteed** to execute in that branch.\n\n  `S2` is **control-dependent** on `S1` if there exists a **transitive chain** of control dependencies from `S1` to `S2`, where each intermediate step in the chain represents a **direct** control dependence between two statements.\n\n\n\n## 2. Output Format\nWhen asked, \"Which lines have control dependence over `targetLine`? List all such lines.\" You should respond in JSON format as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"ControlDependenceSources\": [S1, ..., S2]\n}\n```\n  \nIf you believe there is no line that has control dependence over `targetLine`, respond:\n```json\n{\n  \"ControlDependenceSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n    \n\n## 3. Interprocedural Control Dependence\n  All dependence analysis is performed within **a single function**. We do not track dependencies across function boundaries. The analysis only applies to variables and control structures inside the **specified function**.\n\n\n## 4. Example Code Snippet\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\n1  if x > 0:\n2      y = 10       # this line is directly control-dependent on line 1 (x>0)\n3      if y > 5:\n4          z = 20   # this line is directly control-dependent on line 3 (y>5)\n5          w = 30   # this line is directly control-dependent on line 3 (y>5)\n6  v = 40           # this line is NOT control-dependent on any line\n```\n\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Line 2 is directly control-dependent on line 1 (`x>0`)\n- Lines 4 and 5 are directly control-dependent on line 3 (`y>5`).\n- Lines 4 and 5 are **indirectly** control-dependent on line 1 (`x>0`) becasue even if line 1 (`x>0`) is `true`, lines 4 and 5 may not execute if line 3\u2019s condition (`y>5`) is `false`. However, since control dependence is transitive, lines 4 and 5 are **indirectly** control-dependent on line 1. \n- Line 6 is not control-dependent on any lines because Line 6 always executes, regardless of whether line 1 (`x>0`) or line 3 (`y>5`) is true or false.\n\n\n\n#### Example Question 1.1: \nWhich lines have control dependence over line `5`? List all such lines.\n\n\n**Output**: \n```json\n{\n  \"ControlDependenceSources\": [1, 3]\n}\n```\n\n#### Example Question 1.2:\nWhich lines have control dependence over line `6`? List all such lines.\n\n**Output**: \n```json\n{\n  \"ControlDependenceSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\n1  count = 0\n2  if count < 5:\n3      count += 1\n4  print(\"Step 1 done\")\n5  while count < 10:\n6      if count == 7:\n7          break\n8      if count % 2 == 0:\n9          continue\n10     count += 2\n11     if count > 9:\n12         count = 9\n13     print(\"Iteration done\")\n14 print(\"End of program\")\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.1: \nWhich lines have control dependence over line `13`? List all such lines.\n\n**Analysis**:\n  - Line 13 is directly control-dependent on line 8 because if line 8 evaluates to `true`, continue skips line 13 for that iteration.\n  - Line 8 is directly control-dependent on line 6 because if line 6 evaluates to `true`, the break statement terminates the loop, preventing line 8 from executing.\n  - Line 6 is directly control-dependent on line 5 because the loop condition at line 5 determines whether line 6 executes. If line 5 evaluates to `false`, execution skips the loop entirely.\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ControlDependenceSources\": [5, 6, 8]\n}\n```\n\n#### Example Question 2.2: \nWhich lines have control dependence over line `10`? List all such lines.\n\n\n**Analysis**: Similar to the explanation above, line 8 is an `if` condition inside the `while` loop with a `continue`, so it can make the execution skip the rest of the loop entirely, including line 10. \n\n\n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ControlDependenceSources\": [5, 6, 8]\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.3: \nWhich lines have control dependence over line `14`? List all such lines.\n\n**Analysis**: Line 14 is outside the while loop (lines 5 -- 13) and will be executed regardless of the condition. \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ControlDependenceSources\": []\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Example Question 2.4: \nWhich lines have control dependence over line `12`? List all such lines.\n\n**Analysis**: Line 2 doesn't affect whether line 12 is reached. The condition in line 2 only controls whether line 3 is executed. Line 12 is in while loop (line 5 -- 13) and will or will not be executed regardless of the condition in line 2. \n\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"ControlDependenceSources\": [5, 6, 8, 11]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n[YOUR TURN]\n\nBelow is **your target snippet**. \n\n```C\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   #include <string.h>\n3   #define max(a,b) ((a)>=(b)?(a):(b))\n4   int dp[3001][3001];\n5   char buf[30], *p;\n6   int getint()\n7   {\n8   \tint n = 0;\n9   \twhile (*p >= '0') n = (n<<3) + (n<<1) + (*p++ & 0xf);\n10  \treturn n;\n11  }\n12  int main()\n13  {\t\n14  \tint a[3001];\n15  \tint b[3001];\n16  \tint n, t, s, i, j, k, ans;\n17  \tfgets(p=buf, 30, stdin);\n18  \tn = getint();\n19  \tp++;\n20  \tt = getint();\n21  \tp++;\n22  \ts = getint();\n23  \tfor (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n24  \t\tfgets(p=buf, 30, stdin);\n25  \t\ta[i] = getint();\n26  \t\tp++;\n27  \t\tb[i] = getint();\n28  \t}\n29  \tans = 0;\n30  \tfor (i = 1; i <= n; i++) \n31  \t\tfor (j = 1; j <= t; j++) {\n32  \t\t\tdp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);\n33  \t\t\tk = j-b[i];\n34  \t\t\tif (k >= 0 && (s <= k || j <= s))\n35  \t\t\t\tdp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + a[i]);\n36  \t\t\tans = max(ans, dp[i][j]);\n37  \t\t}\n38  \tprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n39  \treturn 0;\n40  }\n```\n\n\n**Question**: Which lines have control dependence over line `33` in function `main`?
